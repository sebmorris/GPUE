          Graphics-Processing Unit Gross--Piteavskii Equation solver
Options:

-A rotation     Set gauge field mode [beta]

-E 0.0001 123   Perform energy calculations, exit groundstate simulations early
                    The calculation frequency defaults to printSteps.
                    Otherwise the threshold and frequency must be given.
-e 1            Set esteps, number of real-time evolution steps
-f              Unset write to file flag

-H phrase       Print help menu, searching for "phrase"
-h              Print help menu, exit GPUE
-I "param.cfg"  Set Input parameter file
-i 1            Set interaction strength between particles

                    killed/flipped/mutliply-charged
-k 0            Set kick_it, kicking for Moire lattice simulations
                    0 = off, 1 = periodic kicking, 2 = single kick

-p 100          Set printSteps, frequency of printing
-Q 0            Set z0_shift, z shift of kicking potential (bad flag, I know)
-q 0            Set the vortex winding for imprinting/annihilation/flipping 
                    during real-time. The value is the charge of the new vortex

-U 0            Set x0_shift, x shift of kicking potential, shift of the 
                    imprinting vortex position defined by K and q
-u              Performs all unit tests
-V 0            Set y0_shift, y shift of kicking potential, shift of the

Notes:

- Parameters specified above represent the default values for the classic 
  linear Schrodinger equation and may need to be modified to match your
  specific problem.

- We use real units with an Rb87 condensate

- You may generate a simple vortex lattice in 2d with the following command:
  ./gpue -x 512 -y 512 -g 50000 -e 1 -p 5000 -W -w 0.6 -n 1e5 -s -l -Z 100

- Thanks for using GPUE!
